# Type Level Logic for Rust

This crate provides various primitives for writing type-level code in Rust. It makes heavy use of the [type-operators](https://crates.io/crates/type-operators) crate, and provides strongly enforced and weakly enforced variants of numerical logic, boolean logic, and other useful components.

Current features:
- Unsigned integers (using a ternary representation)
- Signed integers (using a balanced ternary representation)

Projected features:
- Boolean logic
- Type-level lists and sets
